''' Data structure to hold candidate and matching order scheme 
	The structure is very similar to the template graph except that each node (called supernode)
	will be an array of vertices and there will be superedges between the nodes corresponding
	to the edges in the template graph (this is where the BFS tree comes from?)

	Also, the candidates in each node will contain edges in each other.
	# should store in this structure? Or should query from the existing world graph 
	An edge between two candidates in two supernodes exists iff a 
	superedge exist in their containing supernodes as well as if there is an edge 
	between those candidates in the world graph''' 
from .supernodes import Supernode 

class CandidateStructure:
	''' Contains 	supernodes: corresponding to template's nodes (with candidates)
					superedges (between super nodes): corresponding to template's edges
					candidate-edges: between two candidates in two supernodes
						-> exists iff superedge exists and world edge exists between the two candidates '''

	# matching algorithm should have some good ordering to follow candidate-edges

	# 	obtain neighbor list of current node -> sort and append to order  (how to get neighbors?)
